            <h1>Instructions on how to update an outdated Questionnaire</h1>
			<p> When new versions of a Knowledge Model is released, questionnaires based on 
			earlier versions becomes marked as outdated. You don't have to do anything, 
			but hopefully the newer Knowledge Model has an improved value, with new 
			questions or better guidance. In order to make the questionnaire
			up-to-date, you can use the Create migration function.</br></p>
