          <h1>Instructions on how to update an outdated Project</h1>
			<p> When new versions of a Knowledge Model is released, projects based on 
			earlier versions becomes marked as outdated. You don't <i>have to</i> do anything, 
			but hopefully the newer Knowledge Model has an improved value, with new 
			questions or better guidance. In order to make the project
			up-to-date, you can use the <b>Create Migration</b> function.<br></p>

			<br><br>
			<h2>First step</h2>
			<p>In the first dialogue window, select the highest version number as New Version 
			and click on <b>Create</b>.<br>
			<i><b>Note:</b> The old, outdated version will remain unchanged until you specifically delete	
			it, these steps will create an updated copy. If the outdated version has been shared 
			with collaborators, we recommend that you remove the <code>Share >> Public link</code>, in order to 
			prevent that a collaborator continues to work in the outdated version instead of in 
			the new one.</i><br><br>

			displays an overview with the type of difference for each question, whether it is 
			a new or a changed one. <br>
			In the right panel the detailed difference is displayed. Highlighted in yellow 
			is the current change you need to approve of by clicking on <b>Resolve</b> in the 
			top right corner. <br><br>

			visible in the top right corner, click on it to finish the update. This will open the updated
			project. <br><br></p>
