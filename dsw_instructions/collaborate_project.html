          <h1>How to share and collaborate on a project</h1>
            <p>
                There might be situations where you want others to have access to your project: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborators in the project needs to answer some questions</li>
                    <li>You want a stakeholder, such as the NBIS data steward or a SNIC center, to be 
                        able to view the answers</li>
                </ul>
                Start by clicking on <code>Share</code> in the top right corner of the navigation bar.<br>
                <br><img src="./img/share.jpg" alt="share_image">
                <br><br>
                There are three ways to open up the project for sharing, by adding specific users, by enabiling 
                the visiblity, or by activating a public link. <br>
                <br><img src="./img/share-user-public.jpg" alt="share-user-public_image">
                <br><br>
                <b>Add users</b><br>
                Click in the field <code>Add users</code> and start typing the name of the person you 
                want to share with (requires an account at the DS Wizard). Select this user from the resulting 
                list of names, and then select the role you want this person to have (Viewer, Commenter, Editor, Owner).<br><br>
                <b>Visibility</b><br>
                If you want to share the project with all who has an account in DS Wizard, you can change the visibility 
                of the project (default is that a project is only visible to you and users you have added). <br>
                Activate the <code>Visible by all other logged-in users</code> and select if you want them to 
                <b>view</b>, <b>comment</b> or <b>edit</b>.<br><br>
                <b>Public link</b><br>
                If you want to share the project with people who doesn't have an account in DS Wizard, 
                you can make a public link instead of adding users.<br>
                Activate the <code>Public link</code> and select if you want the person(s) with the link to 
                <b>view</b>, <b>comment</b> or <b>edit</b>. Now you can copy the link in the address bar and share with whomever 
                you want, without them having to log in.
                <br><br>
                Click on <code>Save</code>.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Add comment</b><br>
                It is possible to add comments by clicking on the bubble icon next to a question, 
                adding a comment and then click on the <code>Comment</code> button.<br>
                <br><img src="./img/comment-add.jpg" alt="add-comment_image"><br><br>
                As in other tools, where adding comments are possible, one can reply, mark as solved, or 
                delete. <br>
