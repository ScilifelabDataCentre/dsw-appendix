            <h1>Help with deciding repository type</h1>
            
            <h2>What's up?</h2>
            
            <p>
              The text below is copied and adapted from the repository guidelines in <a href="https://f1000.com/resources/FAIR_Open_Guide.pdf">
			  Your go-to guide to making your data Findabel, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)</a>. 
			  Depositing your data in a publicly accessible recognised repository which assigns a globally persistent 
			  identifier ensures that your dataset continues to be available to both humans and machines in a useable 
			  form in the future. Funders and journals often maintain a list of endorsed repositories for your use. 
			  Still, choosing the best repository from such lists can often be daunting. Here, we offer some preliminary 
			  guidance on how to select a data repository.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Does your data contain personal or sensitive information that cannot be fully anonymised?</h2>
			<h3>Controlled access repositories</h3>
            <p>
              There may be cases where openly sharing data is not feasible due to ethical or confidentiality 
			  considerations. Depending on what the ethical board approving your study said about data sharing, 
			  and the level of permission granted from participants, it may still be possible to make your data 
			  accessible to authenticated users via a controlled-access repository.
            </p>

            <h2>Is there a discipline specific repository for your dataset?</h2>
			<h3>Discipline-specific repositories </h3>
            <p>
              Research data differs greatly across disciplines. Discipline-specific repositories offer specialist 
			  domain knowledge and curation expertise for particular data types. Using a discipline-specific repository 
			  makes your data visible to others in your community.
            </p>
            
			<h2>Does your institutional repository accept data?</h2>
			<h3>Institutional repositories </h3>
            <p>
              Many institutions offer support to their employees for managing and depositing data. Institutional 
			  repositories that accept datasets provide stewardship, helping to ensure that your dataset is preserved 
			  and accessible.
            </p>
			<h2>Answered no on all questions above?</h2>
			<h3>General data repositories </h3>
            <p>
              General data repositories accept datasets regardless of discipline or institution. These repositories 
			  support a wide variety of file types and are particularly useful  where a discipline-specific repository 
			  does not exist.
