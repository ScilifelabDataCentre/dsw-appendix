              FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable: <br>
			  <ul>
				<li>To be <b>Findable</b>: Data and metadata should be easy to find by both 
				humans and computer systems. Basic machine readable descriptive metadata 
				allows the discovery of interesting data sets and services. </li>
				<li>To be <b>Accessible</b>: Data and metadata should be stored for the long 
				term such that they can be easily accessed and downloaded or locally 
				used by machines and humans using standard communication protocols. </li>
				<li>To be <b>Interoperable</b>: Data should be ready to be exchanged, interpreted 
				and combined in a (semi)automated way with other data sets by humans as 
				well as computer systems. </li>
				<li>To be <b>Reusable</b>: Data and metadata are sufficiently well-described 
				to allow data to be reused in future research, allowing for integration 
				with other compatible data sources. Proper citation must be facilitated, 
				and the conditions under which the data can be used should be clear to 
				machines and humans. </li>

					  Interoperability typically means that each computer system has at least 
					  knowledge of the other system’s formats in which data is exchanged. If 
					  (meta)data are to be searchable and if compatible data sources should 
					  be combinable in a (semi)automatic way, computer systems need to be able 
					  to decide if the content of data sets are comparable. Obvious issues arise 
					  when different languages are used to describe the data or when spelling errors 
					  make the comparison of descriptions and variable names more difficult. It 
					  is critical to use controlled vocabularies and a well-defined framework 
					  to describe and structure (meta)data in order to ensure findability and 
					  interoperability of datasets.
					  </td>
					  <td class="table-tr1" style="width: 550px">
					  Provide machine readable data and metadata in an accessible language, 
					  using a well-established formalism. In particular, data and metadata 
					  are annotated with resolvable vocabularies/ontologies/thesauri that are 
					  commonly used in the field. The RDF extensible knowledge representation 
					  model is a way to describe and structure datasets. You can refer to the 
					  Dublin Core Schema as an example.

					  If the data set builds on another data set, if additional data
