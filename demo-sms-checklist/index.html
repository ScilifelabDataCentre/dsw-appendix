              <h2> Purpose </h2>
              <p>
                The purpose of NBIS SMS (short- and medium-term support) Checklist is
                to be a tool that helps to go through the main points of data management
                strategies for the support project, as well as provide the NBIS Data Steward with
                sufficient information to be able to assist with data management issues in
                general and specifically with data publication.<br><br>

                The Checklist is divided into two parts, Phase 1 and Phase 2, to be walked-through
                at separate occasions: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Phase 1</b> - At the time of the first meeting between NBIS Bioinformatician and
                the Research group, before the contract is signed.</li>
                    <li> <b>Phase 2</b> - At a start-up data management meeting, between the Research group,
                NBIS Data Steward and Bioinformatician, when the project starts.</li>
              </ul>
                The expected process is that the Checklist is owned and initiated by the
                dedicated NBIS Bioinformatician. This person is making sure that the questions
                in Phase 1 are answered during a first meeting with the Researcher. After
                the contract is signed, the assigned Data Steward will go through the answers and
                determine if assistance is needed. In such cases, a data management meeting will be
                arranged, during which the Phase 2 questions of the Checklist will be addressed.<br><br>

                <i><b>Note:</b> This demo is NOT for creating a data management plan, for that

                    answered. This number will be reduced while answering, and when all questions are answered 
                    a tick will appear instead (see for example the chapter 'Phase 2 checklist' which is ticked 
                    already for this phase).</li>

                The DSW provides a filtering feature that allows you to see questions relevant only
                to a particular phase of a research project. When answering questions in <b>Phase 1</b>, 
                 the default 'Support planning' is to be used.
                <ul>
                  <li>The answers will be saved automatically.</li>

                  <li>Under most of the questions you will find guidance or advice on how to answer
                    or what to consider. </li>

                  <li>For some questions you may provide more than one answer. If you want to add a new
                    answer click the <code>Add</code> button at the end of your last answer. <i>Note: When
                      doing so, you might need to scroll up in order to get to the first field to be filled.</i></li>

                  <li>Your checklist is ready to be filled. Answer the questions in red, once a question
                    has been answered it becomes green. </li>

              <p>
                The tool has a TODO function, which lets you mark questions where an action is necessary. This is
                useful (and encouraged) e.g. if you need to collect an answer from a collaborator, or if you
                want to think about the answer for a while and get back to it later.
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Click on <code>Phase 1 checklist</code> in the Chapters overview menu
                    and scroll down to the question <code>2. Will there be a Data Management Plan (DMP) for the 
                    project?</code></li>
                    <br><img src="./img/todo.jpg" alt="todo_image"><br><br>
                  <li>Hover on the <code>+</code> sign next to this question, and then click on the
                    appearing <code>+ Add TODO</code>.</li>
                  <li>Notice that you now have 1 TODOs in the features bar at the top of the page. If
                    you click on it you will see a list with the question(s) which need an action. The list is
                    linked, so clicking on an item in the list will lead you directly to it.
                  </li>
                  <br><img src="./img/todo-navigation.jpg" alt="todo_navigation_image"><br><br>
                  <li>To remove a TODO, just click on the yellow <code>TODO X</code>.</li>

              <hr>
              <h2 id="Create_document">Create an output document</h2>
              <p>
                When the questions are answered you can create a document with your answers, and download it to
                your computer.
                <ul>
                    <lh><b>Example</b></lh>
                    <li>Click on <code>Documents</code> in the navigation bar at the top of the page.</li>
                    <li>Click on the <code>New document</code> button.</li>
                      <br><img src="./img/document-create.jpg" alt="document-create_image"><br><br>                    
                    <li>By default the document template is <code>SMS checklist Phase 1</code>. There are 
                      two other document templates available, one which will output Phase 2 questions and 
                      answers, and one that will output both phases. Click on the template if you wish to 
                      change into one of the other templates. </li>
                    <li>The default document format is <code>MS Word Document</code>, but you can select 
                      any of the other formats as well. </li>
                    <li>Click <code>Create</code></li>
                    <br><img src="./img/document-settings.jpg" alt="document-settings_image"><br><br>

                    <li>To inspect the resulting document, click on the three vertical dots to the left of
                      the document and select <code>Download</code> in the appearing menu.</li>

              <p>
                There might be situations where you want others to have access to your checklist:
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborators in the project need to answer some questions</li>
                    <li>A stakeholder, such as the Researcher, want to view the answers</li>
                </ul>
                In order to make this possible, start by clicking on <code>Share</code> in the 
                top right corner of the navigation bar.<br>
                <br><img src="./img/share.jpg" alt="share_image">
                <br><br>
                There are two ways to open up the checklist for sharing, either by adding specific 
                users or by activating a public link. <br>
                <br><img src="./img/share-public.jpg" alt="share-public_image">
                <br><br>
                <b>Add users</b><br>
                Click in the field <code>Add users</code> and start typing the name of the person you 
                want to share with (requires an account at the DS Wizard). Select this user from the 
                resulting list of names, and then select the role you want this person to have (Viewer, 
                Editor, Owner).<br><br>
                <b>Public link</b><br>
                If you want to share the checklist with people who don't have an account in DS Wizard, 
                you can make a public link instead of adding users.<br>
                Activate the <code>Public link</code> and select if you want the person(s) with the link to 
                <b>view</b> or <b>edit</b>. Now you can copy the link in the address bar (e.g. 
                <a href="https://dsw.scilifelab.se/projects/124e8dfb-665c-4135-bab6-3d48765f739a">999_MyProject</a>) 
                and share with whomever you want, without them having to log in.
                <br><br>
                Click on <code>Save</code>.<br>

                <b>Add comment</b><br>
                It is possible to add comments by clicking on the bubble icon next to a question, 
                adding a comment and then click on the <code>Comment</code> button.<br>
                <br><img src="./img/comment-add.jpg" alt="add-comment_image"><br><br>
                As in other tools, where adding comments are possible, one can reply, mark as solved, or 
                delete. <br>

                When we update a template, you will get an <code>update available</code> tag next to the name of your 
                project, to make you aware that you are not working with the latest version of the template.<br><br>

                <br><img src="./img/outdated.jpg" alt="outdated_image">
                <br><br>
                You don't <i>have to</i> do anything, but hopefully the updates have an improved value, 
                with new questions or better guidance. In order to make the project up-to-date, you can use 
                the <b>Create Migration</b> function.<br><br>
                <img src="./img/migrate-project.jpg" alt="migrate-project_image"><br><br>

			          <h4>First step</h4>
			          In the first dialogue window, select the highest version number as New Version and click on <b>Create</b>.<br><br>
			          <i><b>Note:</b> The outdated version will remain unchanged until you specifically delete it, these
                steps will create an updated copy. Unless you really do want to keep the outdated version, we recommend that
                the outdated version is deleted after the migration is finalized. If you do keep the outdated version, we
                recommend that you deactivate the <code>Share >> Public link</code> in order to prevent that a collaborator continues to
                work in the outdated version instead of in the new one.

			          <h4>Second step </h4>
                A window with the differences between the versions appear. The left panel displays an overview
                with the type of difference for each question, whether it is a new or a changed one. <br>
			          In the right panel the detailed difference is displayed. Highlighted in yellow
			          is the current change you need to approve of by clicking on <b>Resolve</b> in the

			          <img src="./img/migrate-2-dialogue.jpg" alt="migrate_step2_image">

			          <h4>Third step </h4>
						    When all changes have been resolved, an option to <b>Finalize Migration</b> will become
			          visible in the top right corner, click on it to finish the update. This will open the updated
			          project, so that you can see if there are new questions to be answered. <br><br>

                If you want to have different versions of the checklist, e.g. one version when applying for
                support, one version during the project, and one version at the end of the project, this is
                possible using the <b>Clone</b> function: <br><br>
			          <img src="./img/clone-start.jpg" alt="clone-start_image"><br><br>
			          The clone will get the prefix 'Copy of ' as name (e.g. 'Copy of 999_MyProject').
                To change the name, click on it to open it, then click on <b>Settings</b> in the
                navigation bar at the top. Change the name (and possibly other settings, like adding a description) and click on
