                    <li>In compliance with the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of 
                      the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the 
                      processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing 
                      Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, further in this text referred 
                      to as ‘GDPR’), SciLifeLab Data Centre at Uppsala University informs the entities on terms 
                      and conditions under which personal data in providing DSW services are processed. Data 
                      subjects are natural persons using the services of DSW. </li>
                    <li>The controller of the personal data as defined by GDPR is Uppsala University, 
                      SciLifeLab Data Centre, Dept. of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Husargatan 3, 
                      751 08 Uppsala, Sweden (further in this text referred to as "SciLifeLab Data Centre"). </li>
                    <li>The Data Stewardship Wizard web portal and its services (further in this text referred 
                      to as "DSW") is a public web portal providing services to entities which conform to the 
                      Terms and conditions for the access. By accessing DSW, the entity (and through it 
                      individual natural persons – for instance employees and students, i.e. data subjects under 
                      GDPR) gains access to a unique portfolio of information and communication technology 
                      services supporting data stewardship. </li>
                    <li>As regards the access to the services of DSW, the services are two-fold: services 
                      the access to which does not require authentication and authorisation; and services the 
                      access to which requires authentication and authorisation. To access the services 
                      requiring authentication and authorisation, an user account needs to be created.</li>
                    <li>As regards the access to the services of DSW the access to which requires 
                      authentication and authorisation, the following personal data are being processed: 
                      name, surname, e-mail.</li>
                    <li>As regards the access to the services of DSW the access to which does not require 
                      authentication and authorisation, the following personal data are being processed: IP 
                      address (and other identifiers enabling the identification of the communication source 
                      and target) and other unique identifiers applied by individual services of DSW. </li>
                    <li>The processing of personal data is first launched upon the first use of any DSW’s 
                      service. Non-anonymous personal data such as name, surname and e-mail are stored over 
                      the entire period of usage of DSW’s services. For security reasons (in particular in 
                      order to prevent any duplicity of user account identities) and for accounting and 
                      reporting reasons personal data including name, surname and e-mail are also stored after 
                      the services of DSW are no longer used. The data controller defines the technical and 
                      organisations terms and conditions for securing personal data so that their integrity 
                      and confidentiality is not breached.</li>

                      unique identifiers applied by individual services of DSW will be kept for at most 18 months.</li>
                    <li>Personal data relating to information about the usage of DSW resources are stored for 
                      the period for which they are deemed necessary for the provision and improvement of
