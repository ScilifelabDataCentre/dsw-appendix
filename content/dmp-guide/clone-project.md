# Instructions on how to create a copy of existing Project

If you want to have different versions of a project, e.g. one version when applying for grant, one version during project, and one version at the end of the project, this is possible using the **Clone** function:

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/dmp-guide/clone_project.jpg" alt="clone_project_image">

The clone will get the prefix 'Copy of ' as name (e.g. 'Copy of DemoResearcher-VR-Project_v1'). To change the name, click on it to open the project, then click on **Settings** in the navigation bar at the top. Change the name (and possibly other settings) and click on **Save**.
