# Useful tips and tricks

There are some additional functionality incorporated into the Data Stewardship wizard, which can be very handy to know about:

* [Collaps left hand menu](#collaps-left-menu)
* [Use Zen mode](#zen-mode)
* [Change Views](#view)
* [Preview document](#preview-document)
* [Version control](#version-control)

## Collaps left hand menu {#collaps-left-menu}

The wizard can take up a lot of space on your screen, and by clicking on `Collaps sidebar` more space is released while working inside a Project.

## Use Zen mode {#zen-mode}

To further free up some space on your screen, there is a `Zen` mode functionality, accessible on the right in the features bar. Click and unclick to show / hide panels and views.

## Change Views {#view}

Also information around the questions can be shown or hidden, using the `View` tab in the features bar. You can hide tags, phase, and who answered when, repectively.

## Preview document {#preview-document}

If the document type is set to PDF or HTML in `Settings`, the `Preview` tab in the navigation bar allows you to see what the output document will look like, without having to download it first.

## Version control {#version-control}

All changes made to a questionnaire are saved automatically, and the Wizard has a version control functionality which is accessible via the `Version history` tab in the features bar. The versions are sorted by date, with the current one first. By clicking on the three vertical dots next to a version, you have e.g. the possibility to name that version (for future easy access), and to revert to this version (in case some errors were introduced in the current version that you regret). To hide the versions, click on the `Version history` again.
