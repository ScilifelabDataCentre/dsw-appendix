# How to create a document for a Project

When all questions are answered, you can create a Data Management Plan (DMP) file (a.k.a. a Document).

Click on `Document` in the top navigation bar, and then on `New document`

* The **Name** field is prefilled with the name of the Project, but we recommend adding an identifier to give this version of the DMP a unique name (eg a number, the project phase, funder, date, etc).
* There are several **file formats** to choose between. MS Word is the default since it allows you to view and edit the document previous to submitting it to a stakeholder. The output template only makes a generic transformation, of the questionnaire answers into the stakeholder's template, and might need refinement.
* Click on `Create`.

In order to download the document, click on the three vertical dots right-most to the name of the document and select `Download` in the appearing menu.
