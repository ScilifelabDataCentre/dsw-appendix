# Data Stewardship Wizard appendix

The appendix is used for providing additional information when using SciLifeLab instances of the Data Stewardship Wizard (DSW). It is mainly used to host guides for how to use this tool, i.e. how to navigate the funtionality when e.g. using DSW to create a data management plan, but can also host reference pages.

## Guide for creating a Data Management Plan

Follow the 'How to'-links below to get help on the different functions of DSW when writing a data management plan.

**How to:**

* [Create a Project](/dmp-guide/new-project)
* [Answer questions](/dmp-guide/answer-questions)
* [Create a document for a Project](/dmp-guide/export-project)
* [Share and Collaborate on a Project](/dmp-guide/collaborate-project)
* [Update an outdated Project](/dmp-guide/migrate-project)
* [Create a copy of existing Project](/dmp-guide/clone-project)
* [Get Help and provide Feedback](/dmp-guide/help-feedback)

## NBIS Support Checklist

The purpose of NBIS Support Checklist is to be a tool that helps to go through the main points of data management strategies for NBIS support projects. The **[Guide for creating NBIS Support Checklist](/checklist-guide/)** goes through the DSW functionality from this point of view.

## Additional tips and tricks

* [Useful tricks](/dmp-guide/useful-tricks) - some functions not covered by the guides
* [List of all project templates](/project-templates/) and when to use them
* [List of all knowledge models](/knowledge-models/) (for Data Stewards)

* [Youtube video clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGpr6JFMuiE) from a workshop organized by the [team](https://ds-wizard.org/) who developed DS Wizard. The video clip demonstrates the functionality both from a researcher's and a data steward's point of view.

## Terminology {#terminology}

* `DMP` = data management plan; describes the strategies chosen regarding how the data is managed during, and after, a research project
* `Knowledge Model` = questionnaire template; specifies which questions will be asked
* `Questionnaire` = question form; displays the questions that are asked in order to create a DMP (or other document); its structure is based on the selected knowledge model
* `Project` = grouping of a questionnaire, its documents, and related settings together
* `Document` = generated output file of a questionnaire based on the selected output format template (often, but not necessarily, a DMP)
* `Project template` = a predefined setting of which knowledge model to use and which document template to use
* `Document template` = defines how the answers in a questionnaire is collected and transformed into a document such as a data management plan for a specific funder
